### Hello, I'm Aishwarya Hammigi 👋

I am passionate about leveraging technology to solve real-world problems and making an impact through creative solutions. 
Here's a glimpse into my journey:  


## 🛠 Projects

### **HOMELESSNESS AND LIVING CONDITIONS**  

**OVERVIEW:**
1. Economic Factors: Unemployment, low wages, and rising costs of living can lead to homelessness.
2. Housing Issues: Lack of affordable housing, evictions, and housing discrimination are significant contributors.
3. Health Problems: Mental illness, substance abuse, and chronic health conditions can result in or exacerbate homelessness.
4. Systemic Issues: Inadequate social services, lack of mental health care, and insufficient support for veterans and marginalized groups.
Living Conditions of the Homeless
5. Shelters: Many homeless individuals rely on temporary shelters for accommodation. However, shelters often have limited capacity and may not be available year-round.
6. Unsheltered Homelessness: Some live in public spaces like parks, streets, and abandoned buildings. These conditions are harsh and unsafe.
7. Encampments: Informal settlements, or tent cities, are created by homeless communities. While they offer some protection and community, they often lack basic amenities.

**Technical Stack:**  
1. Languages: C++, Java
2. Algorithms: Dijkstra’s, Greedy Algorithm, Dynamic Programming, Graph Traversal (DFS/BFS), Max Flow
3. Tools: Graphs, DAA Optimization Techniques

**Impact:**
1. Health: Poor physical and mental health, higher mortality rates.
2. Safety: Increased risk of violence and exploitation.Education: Disruption in schooling, affecting future opportunities.
3. Development: Emotional and cognitive challenges in children.
4. Public Health: Spread of diseases due to poor living conditions.
5. Social Issues: Increased crime perception, social tension, and community strain.
## 🚀 **Skills**
